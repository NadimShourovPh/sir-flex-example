          School Life is the best time of our life as we make new friends, learn
          new things and build our career there. School time is the only time
          which we enjoy most, and when we enter college, we always miss our
          school life. School life teaches us lots of new things and prepares us
          to face all the challenges of life. I love my school life and really
          enjoy it. I have lots of friends, and all my teachers love me. I love
          my school and enjoy going there every day to meet my friends and learn
          new things.
